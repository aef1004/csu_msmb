Mike Lyons is an assistant professor at Colorado State University. He 
works on pre-clinical and clinical drug development for the treatment of 
tuberculosis.  His focus is the development and application of mathematical 
and computational tools for clinical trials. This work involves both
conventional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation as 
well as physiological modeling and the use of engineering-based approaches 
to design optimized combination drug regimens.
