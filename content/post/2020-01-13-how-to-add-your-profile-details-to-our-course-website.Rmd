One goal of this course is to continue developing your data science programming 
skills. This will include plenty of work on R programming, but also more work to 
help you learn tools for reproducible research, like
[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/). 

We will be using our course website as a collaboration tool during this course.
This website was created using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/),
which allows you to create and update a blogging website using R and RStudio. We
are using a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb) to share
all the code for this website and serving the site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

During this course, you will have two graded products that you will need to 
submit as blog posts to our site. One will be a glossary for one chapter of the 
book, listing key words and their definitions for the chapter. The second is 
the "official" version of one week's in-course exercise. 

To help get you up to speed with using blogdown, GitHub, and RMarkdown with 
our site, we'll start by having you update your profile details for our website. 
This post covers the details for how to do that. 

# Required set-up

This exercise, and this course as a whole, requires a certain set-up
on your computer:

1. R installed on your laptop 
2. RStudio installed on your laptop 
3. git installed on your laptop 
4. Your own GitHub account

If you already have all this set-up, you can skip to the next section of 
the blog. Otherwise, this section has details on completing this set up.

## Install R on your laptop 

You can install R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
Search for the version appropriate for your computer's operating system. If you already
have R installed, check your version number. If it's older than six months or so, you 
should probably update your version for the class. You can use the `sessionInfo()` function
to find out details about your current R session, including the version of R you're 
currently running: 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Based on the return from this call, for example, I can tell that I have 
`r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string`.

## Install RStudio on your laptop 

You can download RStudio directly 
[from their website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). The free
Desktop version will work great for this course. If your version of RStudio is
more than a year old, you should probably update it for this course.

## Install git on your laptop 

## Get a GitHub account

# About *blogdown*

[Add a brief description of blogdown / Hugo / static websites.]

You will need to install two pieces of software to work on our 
website. First, you'll need the R package `blogdown`. You can install
this package in the normal way, using `install.packages`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
```

Once you have `blogdown`, you can install the Hugo software using a function
in the `blogdown` package, `install_hugo`: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()
```

For both these installations, your computer will need to be online or you'll 
get an error.

# Getting a fork of our repository on your computer

All our websites files are posted in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb. With this (or any) GitHub repository, 
you can suggest changes by *forking* the repository, cloning the fork to
your computer, making and commiting the changes, pushing those commits
back up to your fork of the repository on GitHub, and then submitting
a *pull request*.

# Updating your profile details

## Navigating the website's file directory to find your profile

We all have our own author profile in a subdirectory within the 
website's files. To find yours, go to the "content" subdirectory
of the website files and then the "authors" subdirectory within that.
You should see a subdirectory there with your name. Click on that
and you'll see the two files that make up your author profile, 
"_index.md" and "avatar.jpg".

## Updating your information in "_index.md"

Your details are all given in the "_index.md" file in your author subdirectory. 
To update your details on the website, you'll need to change your details in this
file. 

The file is written in [YAML/TOML?]. Anywhere there is a placeholder, like
"[Year]" or "[Institution]", replace the placeholder with your own information.

![](/img/screencapture_gifs/change_placeholders.gif)

Make sure you change the following sections: 

- "bio"
- "education"
- "email"
- "interests"
- "name"
- "organizations"

Some of the sections in `social:` are commented out, including the information 
for buttons for GitHub, GoogleScholar, and Twitter. If you have accounts through
any of these services, you can add these buttons with your updated information. 
Just delete the `#` at the beginning of all lines in that section and then 
change the handle or web address information so that it links to your 
account for that service, rather than mine.

The very bottom of the file, under the `---`, provides space for you to write
a paragraph summarizing who you are and your academic / research interests.

Be sure to save the file after you've made all your changes.

For an example of a completed "_index.md" file, you can see mine [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geanders/csu_msmb/master/content/authors/brooke-anderson/_index.md).
