One goal of this course is to continue developing your data science programming 
skills. This will include plenty of work on R programming, but also more work to 
help you learn tools for reproducible research, like
[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/). 

We will be using our course website as a collaboration tool during this course.
This website was created using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/),
which allows you to create and update a blogging website using R and RStudio. We
are using a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb) to share
all the code for this website and serving the site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

During this course, you will have two graded products that you will need to 
submit as blog posts to our site. One will be a glossary for one chapter of the 
book, listing key words and their definitions for the chapter. The second is 
the "official" version of one week's in-course exercise. 

To help get you up to speed with using blogdown, GitHub, and RMarkdown with 
our site, we'll start by having you update your profile details for our website. 
This post covers the details for how to do that. 

# Required set-up

This exercise, and this course as a whole, requires a certain set-up
on your computer:

1. R installed on your laptop 
2. RStudio installed on your laptop 
3. git installed on your laptop 
4. Your own GitHub account

If you already have all this set-up, you can skip to the next section of 
the blog. Otherwise, this section has details on completing this set up.

## Install R on your laptop 

You can install R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
Search for the version appropriate for your computer's operating system. If you already
have R installed, check your version number. If it's older than six months or so, you 
should probably update your version for the class. You can use the `sessionInfo()` function
to find out details about your current R session, including the version of R you're 
currently running: 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Based on the return from this call, for example, I can tell that I have 
`r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string`.

## Install RStudio on your laptop 

You can download RStudio directly 
[from their website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). The free
Desktop version will work great for this course. If your version of RStudio is
more than a year old, you should probably update it for this course.

## Install git on your laptop 

The software **git** is version control software, which will help you record and 
track changes that you've made to code and other plain text documents. 

It's free to download. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and select the version
for your operating system. For this software, you're probably okay if you 
downloaded it a little while ago (although if more than two years or so, you might
want to update). 

## Get a GitHub account

You will need a (free) GitHub account for this course. You can sign up for one
(if you don't already have one) at https://github.com/. While there are some 
fancier paid plans available, the free account will work great for this class. 

When you sign up, you'll get to choose a GitHub handle. You might want to make 
this something that will be easy for people to remember. For example, if your
name is still available, that would be a great option. This handle will form 
part of the address to all of your GitHub repositories, so it is convenient if
it is easy for people you work with to remember (mine, unfortunately, is not!). 

# About *blogdown*

[Add a brief description of blogdown / Hugo / static websites.]

You will need to install two pieces of software to work on our 
website. First, you'll need the R package `blogdown`. You can install
this package in the normal way, using `install.packages`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
```

Once you have `blogdown`, you can install the Hugo software using a function
in the `blogdown` package, `install_hugo`: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()
```

For both these installations, your computer will need to be online or you'll 
get an error.

# Getting a fork of our repository on your computer

All our websites files are posted in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb. With this (or any) GitHub repository, 
you can suggest changes by *forking* the repository, cloning the fork to
your computer, making and commiting the changes, pushing those commits
back up to your fork of the repository on GitHub, and then submitting
a *pull request*.

## Forking a GitHub repository

When you **fork** a GitHub repository, you get a copy of that repository that you 
can play around with and change yourself, without it affecting the original 
repository. It's essentially just copying the whole repository, with all its 
files, into a repository on your GitHub account. 

The only thing that makes it different from a plain copy (and what makes it
really powerful in some cases) is that, if you decide that your changes might
make the *original* repository better, you can submit a **pull request**. This
requests that the owners of the original repository update it to incorporate the
changes you've made on your fork of the repository. The original authors can
review each of the **commits** you've made, so they can even cherry-pick your
changes if they want.

GitHub also lets the original authors see if there are any **merge conflicts**
created from changes that they've made to the original repository since you 
forked it. This can let the original authors see how hard it will be to 
incorporate all of your changes in the forked version with their version of the
repository. 

To fork the repository with our course's website materials, all you'll need to
do is go to our [GitHub repository for the course
website](https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb) (while you're signed in to
GitHub) and click on the "Fork" button towards the right of the page. Now go and
check in the "Repositories" section of your own GitHub account---you should see that
you now have a forked copy of the "csu_msmb" repository. 

In this exercise, you'll work with the fork of the repository, and then once you've
made your changes, you submit a pull request, so that we can get your changes
back into the main webpage. 

If you need more help on how to fork a repository, GitHub has a [help
page](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
on the topic that might be useful.

## Cloning the fork to your computer

Next, you'll want to get a copy of your forked repository onto your own computer,
where you can work with it, make changes, and preview the website with your 
updates. 

To do this, you'll **clone** your fork of the repository onto your computer. 
The version of the repository on GitHub is called the **remote** branch of the
repository and the version you get on your computer once you've cloned it is 
the **local** branch. By cloning (instead of just downloading), you'll maintain
a connection between the remote and local versions through git, which will allow
you to push changes that you make and commit on your own computer up to the 
remote branch on GitHub.

Go to GitHub, make sure you are logged into your account, and navigate to your
forked version of the repository for this class. There should be a button to the
right of the page that says "Clone or download" (you may need to scroll down to 
find it). 

When you click on this button, it will give you a choice between 
"SSH" and "HTTPS" for the protocol to use to connect your local and remote branches
of the repository. You're welcome to try either, but I usually (on a Mac) have
better luck with "SSH". Occasionally, people running Windows in my courses have
had better luck with "HTTPS", although for most folks "SSH" seems to work fine.
Once you choose which protocal to use, you can copy the snippet of code that is 
given in the pop-up. 

Next, you'll run this code from a **bash shell** on your own computer to clone the
repository. You first will need to open a shell. If you're on a Mac, you can do that
with the "Terminal" application. With Windows, you'll probably need to use the 
bash shell that comes with the Windows version of git. Search your programs for
"bash" or "git bash" and see if you see something that looks promising. 

Once you open a shell, you'll see a command prompt, like this: 

```
username$
```

You can type **shell commands** here and then press "Return" to run them. You 
should first move into the directory where you want to clone the repository. 
Your "Desktop" might be a good place for it for now (unless you have some
organization you use for course-related files). The `cd` shell command lets you
"change directory". If you don't put anything after `cd`, it will change to 
your **home directory**. Otherwise, it will move to the directory you specify. 
For example, if the "Desktop" directory is a subdirectory of my home directory, 
I could move into it by running: 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd Desktop
```

If you have not use shell commands much before and are having any problems 
navigating to the directory you'd like, let us know in class, and one of us can
help you.

Once you are in this directory, you'll paste `git clone` followed by the command
you copied from the "Clone or download" button on GitHub. It will probably look
something like this:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone git@github.com:geanders/csu_msmb.git
```

When you run this, you may have to put in your GitHub username and password. You 
may also get some questions about whether you really want to download the 
repository (you do). If everything's successful, you should see that there's a new
directory called "csu_msmb" in which directory you decided to put it ("Desktop", 
for example).

If you need more help, GitHub has a [help
page](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
with more on how to clone a repository from GitHub to your own computer.

## Changing and committing in RStudio

# Updating your profile details

## Navigating the website's file directory to find your profile

We all have our own author profile in a subdirectory within the 
website's files. To find yours, go to the "content" subdirectory
of the website files and then the "authors" subdirectory within that.
You should see a subdirectory there with your name. Click on that
and you'll see the two files that make up your author profile, 
"_index.md" and "avatar.jpg".

![](/img/screencapture_gifs/navigating_to_profile.gif)

## Updating your information in "_index.md"

Your details are all given in the "_index.md" file in your author subdirectory. 
To update your details on the website, you'll need to change your details in this
file. 

The file is written in [YAML/TOML?]. Anywhere there is a placeholder, like
"[Year]" or "[Institution]", replace the placeholder with your own information.

![](/img/screencapture_gifs/change_placeholders.gif)

Make sure you change the following sections: 

- "bio"
- "education"
- "email"
- "interests"
- "name"
- "organizations"

Some of the sections in `social:` are commented out, including the information 
for buttons for GitHub, GoogleScholar, and Twitter. If you have accounts through
any of these services, you can add these buttons with your updated information. 
Just delete the `#` at the beginning of all lines in that section and then 
change the handle or web address information so that it links to your 
account for that service. In this section, also update your email address, with 
`mailto:` at the beginning, for the email icon.

![](/img/screencapture_gifs/update_social_section.gif)

The very bottom of the file, under the `---`, provides space for you to write
a paragraph summarizing who you are and your academic / research interests.

![](/img/screencapture_gifs/add_summary_paragraph.gif)

Be sure to save the file after you've made all your changes.

For an example of a completed "_index.md" file, you can see mine [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geanders/csu_msmb/master/content/authors/brooke-anderson/_index.md).
