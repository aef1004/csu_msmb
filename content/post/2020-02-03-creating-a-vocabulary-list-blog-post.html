<p>As one of your assignments for this class, you are responsible for creating a blog
post with all the vocabulary and definitions for one week of the course. This
blog post will explain how you can create and publish that blog post on our
course website.</p>
<div id="create-the-blog-post" class="section level1">
<h1>Create the blog post</h1>
<div id="update-your-fork-of-the-website" class="section level2">
<h2>Update your fork of the website</h2>
<p>You should have already forked our website to add your details for the “Person”
section. You can use this same fork to add your blog post, but you should make sure
you get your fork up-to-date with the current version of the website before you do.</p>
<p>A fork of a repository does not stay up-to-date with the original repository it
copied by itself. Instead, unless you update it, it will continue to be a snapshot
of the original repository (plus any changes you’ve made to your copy) as of
the time when you forked it. If the original has made a lot of changes since you
made your fork, it might be very hard to make a clean pull request as there will
be (potentially) lots of conflicts because of changes made to the original. It’s
considered polite to make sure that you’re working with an up-to-date fork of
a repository if you want to make a pull request back to the original.</p>
