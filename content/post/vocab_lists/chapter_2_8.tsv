Markov chain	a sequence where given the current state, the next state is conditionally independent of all previous states
Prior	a probability distribution describing our knowledge of a hypothesis/parameter before collecting data
Posterior	a probability distribution describing our knowledge of a hypothesis/parameter after collecting data
Haplotype	a collection of alleles (DNA sequence variants) that are spatially adjacent on a chromosome, are usually inherited together, and thus are genetically linked
Marginal distribution	the distribution of Y after integrating out (or marginalizing over) theta. More generally, the distribution of a sub-collection of variables after integrating out the remaining variables in the collection.
Monte Carlo integration	a technique for numerical integration where the value of an integral is estimated by simulating data
Quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot)	a plot comparing the quantiles from one distribution (often a theoretical distribution) to the quantiles of another distribution (often from a sample)
Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate	the mode of the posterior distribution associated with the quantity of interest
Escherichia coli	facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms
Epigenetics	the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence
Log-likelihood ratio	the log of the likelihood under one set of assumptions divided by the likelihood under another set of assumptions
Bimodality	when a distribution has two modes
Mixture	when the distribution of interest is a mixture of two different probability distributions
Codon	A three-nucleotide sequence that specifies the amino acid to be created next (or to start or stop synthesis)
Codon bias	describes the difference in how often each spelling of an amino acid occurs in coding DNA
Genetic code	the set of instructions in a gene that tell the cell how to make a specific protein
