probability model	A mathematical description of the possible outcomes of an experiment and the probability of each of those outcomes.
vector	In programming, a one-dimensional array of data, all with the same data type.
discrete event	In statistics, an event that can take a non-negative integer value (e.g., number of deaths in a community by day).
categorical variable	A variable that can belong to one of a finite set of levels.
levels	In the context of a categorical variable, the set of values to which the variable can be assigned.
factor	In the context of statistical programming, a data type that can take one of a limited number of possible values (e.g., sex, nationality).
exchangeable	A way to describe a random variable for which the order in which the data are observed doesn't matter.
sufficient statistic	A statistic that, even though it is a summary, contains all the information that you would use from an original, uncondensed form of the data. 
Bernoulli distribution	A probability distribution to describe the outcome probability for two possible events (e.g., win / loss).
parameter	A numerical value that describes a population or a model.
complementary	A description of two events who are mutually exclusive and whose probabilities sum to one (i.e., either one event or the other is guaranteed to happen, but not both).
binomial random variable	A variable whose values occur according to a binomial probability distribution.
probability mass distribution	A distribution giving the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to a given value.
Poisson distribution	A probability distribution that is appropriate when the probability of success is small and the number of trials is large.
epitope / antigen determinent	Site on a macromolecular antigen to which an antibody binds. This is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)	An assay that is used to detect specific epitopes at different positions along a protein.
conditional on	Given
cumulative distribution function	A distribution giving the probability that a random variable is less than given values.
extreme value analysis	Analysis focused on the behavior of the very large or the very small values of a random distribution, allowing an exploration of the probability of rare events.
rare event	Something that occurs with a very low probability.
rank statistic	A statistic based on the order of the relative positions of observations based on a certain characteristics.
Monte Carlo method	A method that uses a computer simulation based on a generative model to determine the probabilities of the events we're interested in.
probability or generative modeling	A method of modeling where all the parameters are known and the mathematical theory allows us to work by deduction.
deduction	A top-down method of reasoning, starting from a theory or principle rather than from data.
statistical modeling	A method of modeling where the distribution of the data is not known.
fit	In the context of statistical modeling, estimating the parameters of a model based on observed data thought to be generated by the model.
multinomial	A generalization of the binomial distribution to cases where a certain number of outcomes can occur in each of a number of trials.
power / true positive rate	The probability of detecting something if it is there.
null hypothesis	Often, a hypothesis of "no association" that is used as a counterpart to a more interesting alternative hypothesis in hypothesis testing.
matrix	In programming, a two-dimensional array of data, all with the same data type.
expected value	The predicted value of a variable.
variability / spread / dispersion	In statistics, the amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean.
statistic	A numerical characteristic of a sample.
null distribution	The probability distribution for the null hypothesis.
alternative	In the context of a generating process, the generating process that is considered in comparison to the generating process under the null hypothesis.
chi-squared distribution	A distribution often appropriate for assessing goodness-of-fit, including for models fit to contingency tables.
p-value	The probability of seeing the data that were observed given a hypothesis.
probability density function	A distribution giving the relative likelihood that a continuous random variable is equal to a given value.
default	In the context of function parameters for an R function, the value that is used if no custom value is specified.
C. elegans genome nucleotide frequency	How often adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine occur in the DNA of a roundwork often used in scientific research.
Bioconductor	Open-source software that provides contributed programs for bioinformatic data analysis.
codon	A three-nucleotide sequence that specifies the amino acid to be created next (or to start or stop synthesis).
DNA read	An inferred sequence of base pairs for a single DNA fragment, based on sequencing.
nucleotide	In the context of DNA, one of four compounds (adenine (A); cytosince (C); guanine (G); and tymine (T)) that make up the basic information unit.
genome	An organismâ€™s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes.
replication cycle	In biology, the process that begins with the infection of a host cell by a virus and ends with the release of mature progeny virus particles.
point mutation	A change, addition, or deletion of a single nucleotide in a gene sequence.
genotype	The genetic make-up of an individual's cells, including how the individual's genetic make-up differs from others'.
diploid	Having genetic material in two complete sets of chromosomes, from two parents. 
protein	A compound made up of amino acids; one of the four types of macromolecules that make up living organisms.
antibody	A type of protein made by certain white blood cells in response to an antigen.
antigen	A foreign substance in the body to which the immune system reacts.
