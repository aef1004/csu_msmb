Intercept	A coefficient representing the base level of the measurement in the negative control
Design factors	Binary indicator variables
Interaction effect	A parameter in a model that accounts for the effects of two experimental factors that combine in a more complicated fashion than a simple summation
Design matrix	A matrix encoding the design of an experiment where the columns correspond to experimental factors and the rows correspond to different experimental conditions

Least sum-of-squares fitting	A type of model fitting that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals
Linear model	A model that takes the form: y_j = sum_k (ùë•_jk * ùõÉ_k + ùú∫_j)
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)	An analysis that outlines the systematic variability and noise in a model

Breakdown point	A measure of the robustness of an estimator; larger values indicate more robust estimators
Robust	An estimator with a high degree of robustness against outliers
Least absolute deviations	Minimization of the sum of the absolute values of the residuals
Least quantile of squares	A type of regression where the sum over the squared residuals is replaced with a quantile
Least trimmed sum of squares	A type of regression that uses the sum over the squared residuals over a fraction for the smallest residuals
Logistic regression	A type of generalized linear regression where the outcome is transformed by the logistic function and bounded between 0 and 1
Maximum likelihood	A method that maximizes the product of the probabilistic model where the residuals ~N(0, sigma)
Likelihood	A term describing a case where the product of the probability of the residuals is a function of the model parameters
maximum-likelihood estimates	Model parameters that are estimated by optimising the sum over the squared residuals (thereby optimising the product of the probability of the residuals)
Nuisance factor / Blocking factor	A factor that has some effect on the response but is of no interest to the experiment
Batch effects	Undocumented covariates; hidden factors that affect the data but are not documented
Pseudocounts	Transformations that take the form y = log2(n + n_0) where n is the count and n_0 is a chosen positive constant
Variance stabilizing transformation	A transformation that has finite values and finite slope, even for counts close to zero
Regularized logarithm (rlog) transformation	A technique that transforms the original count data to a log2-like scale by fitting a "trivial" model withh a separate term for each sample and a prior distribution on the coefficients which is estimated from the data
Cook's distance	A measure of how much a single sample is influencing the coefficients for a gene; large values indicate an outlier count
Sampling without replacement	A random sample that no observation occurs more than one time in the sample
Null hypothesis	Often, a hypothesis of ‚Äúno association‚Äù that is used as a counterpart to a more interesting alternative hypothesis in hypothesis testing.
Variability	In statistics, the amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean.
Outlier	A data point with a large residual
M-estimation	A type of regression analysis that is more robust than OLS to outliers or data that does not follow a normal distribution; it minimizes the sum of the penalization function applied to the residuals
Conservative	An approach that does not lead to false positives
Splicing	A process in eukaryotice organisms where mRNA is cut down from the full-length gene to just the exons before being translated
Exons	Segments of a gene that actually get used during translation or encode for a protein
Isoforms	Different forms of the same gene that result from splicing events that combine different exons in an mRNA script
Upregulated	A term used to describe increased expression of a gene
