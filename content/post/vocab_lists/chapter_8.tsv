design factors	binary indicator variables
interaction effect	a parameter in a model that accounts for the effects of two experimental factors that combine in a more complicated fashion than a simple summation
design matrix	a matrix encoding the design of an experiment where the columns correspond to experimental factors and the rows correspond to different experimental conditions
residuals	a term in a model that reflects the experimental fluctuations around the mean between replicates
least sum-of-squares fitting	a type of model fitting that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals
linear model	a model that takes the form: y_j = sum_k (x_jk * beta_k + e_j)
analysis of variance (ANOVA)	an analysis that outlines the systematic variability and noise in a model
noise	variability unaccounted for by model parameters
systematic variability	variability accounted for by model parameters
breakdown point	a measure of the robustness of an estimator; larger values indicate more robust estimators

least absolute deviations	minimization of the sum of the absolute values of the residuals
least quantile of squares	a type of regression where the sum over the squared residuals is replaced with a quantile
least trimmed sum of squares	a type of regression that uses the sum over the squared residuals over a fraction for the smallest residuals
logistic regression	a type of generalized linear regression where the outcome is transformed by the logistic function and bounded between 0 and 1
maximum likelihood	a method that maximizes the product of the probabilistic model where the residuals ~N(0, sigma)
likelihood	a term describing a case where the product of the probability of the residuals is a function of the model parameters
maximum-likelihood estimates	model parameters that are estimated by optimizing the sum over the squared residuals (thereby optimizing the product of the probability of the residuals)
nuisance factor / blocking factor	a factor that has some effect on the response but is of no interest to the experiment
batch effects	hidden factors that affect the data but are not documented; e.g. running samples at the same time have a degree of similarity from being run in the same batch
pseudocounts	transformations that take the form y = log2(n + n_0) where n is the count and n_0 is a chosen positive constant
variance stabilizing transformation	a transformation that has finite values and finite slope, even for counts close to zero
regularized logarithm (rlog) transformation	a technique that transforms the original count data to a log2-like scale by fitting a "trivial" model with a separate term for each sample and a prior distribution on the coefficients which is estimated from the data
Cook's distance	a measure of how much a single sample is influencing the coefficients in a model; large values indicate an outlier count
sampling without replacement	a random sample in which no observation occurs more than one time in the sample
null hypothesis	often, a hypothesis of ‚Äúno association‚Äù that is used as a counterpart to a more interesting alternative hypothesis in hypothesis testing.
variability	in statistics, the amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean.
outlier	a data point with a large residual
M-estimation	a type of regression analysis that is more robust than OLS to outliers or data that does not follow a normal distribution; it minimizes the sum of the penalization function applied to the residuals
conservative	an approach that prioritizes reducing false positives
splicing	a process in eukaryotic organisms where mRNA is cut down from the full-length gene to just the exons before being translated
exons	segments of a gene that actually get used during translation or encode for a protein
isoforms	different forms of the same gene that result from splicing events that combine different exons in an mRNA script
upregulated	a term used to describe the increased expression of a gene
