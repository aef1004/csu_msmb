Graph	formed by a set of nodes or vertices and a set of edges between these vertices
Adjacency matrix A	The matrix representation of edges with as many rows as nodes in the graph
Network	a weighted, directed graph
Sparse	A term to describe a graph when the number of edges is similar to the number of nodes
Dense	A  term to describe a graph when the number of edges is (approximately) a quadratic function of the nodes
Arrows/directed edges	Directionally connects nodes
Annotation variables on nodes and edges	Help to demonstrate strength of a link in a graph by changing the width of the edge or covariates associated to the size or color of the node.
Graph layout	Different ways to plot a graph, either for aesthetic or practical reasons
Data from distances	Transforming data into graphs by simplifying distance matrices by rounding the smaller distances down to zero
Binary data	Data presented as 0/1 matrices
Bipartite graph	A graph that connects each taxon to sites where it was observed
Overrepresented or enriched	Increased expression of a gene or (set of genes) of interest
Hypergeometric testing	two-way table testing used to account for the fact that some categories are extremely numerous and others are rarer
Known skeleton graph	A graph that projects significance scores such as p-values
Perturbed	non uniformly distributed pvalues
Rooted binary trees	a data tree in which each node has at most two children
Cycles	Another word for loops: either self-loops or ones that go through several vertices
Ancestral sequences	Correspond to inner nodes and are inferred from the contemporaneous data on the tips
Contemporaneous data	Data that are entered as soon as they are obtained
OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units)	A method of clustering organisms based on DNA similarity of a certain taxonomic marker gene (Tips of the tree)
Parameter	A numerical value that describes a population
Gene trees	Produced when different genes show differences in their evolutionary histories
The generator	The instantaneous change probability matrix
Transition matrix	Contains all probabilities of any state changes
Parsimony tree	a nonparametric method that minimizes the number of changes necessary to explain the data
Maximum likelihood tree	A parametric method that uses efficient optimization algorithms to maximize the likelihood of a tree under the model assumptions.
Bayesian posterior distributions for trees	use MCMC to find posterior distributions of the phylogenies
Distance based methods	A semi-parametric method similar to the hierarchical clustering algorithms but uses the parametric evolutionary models
Align	Arranging different sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein together to identify similarities or differences between them
Sample information	Typically provided as a spreadsheet and named the meta-data
Spanning tree	A tree that goes through all points at least once
Minimum spanning tree (MST)	Given distances between vertices, it is a tree that spans all the points and has the minimum total length
Jitter	Slightly moving coordinates on a graph to avoid too much overlapping
Undirected 	A graph without arrows between nodes
Associated	Indicates that two variables are related
Friedman-Rafsky	Tests for two/multiple sample segregation on a minimum spanning tree
Pure edges	edges whose two nodes have the same level of the factor variable
