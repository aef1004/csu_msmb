As one of your assignments for this class, you are responsible for creating a blog
post with all the vocabulary and definitions for one week of the course. This 
blog post will explain how you can create and publish that blog post on our 
course website. 

# Create the blog post

## Making a new blog post

In `blogdown`, each blog post is an RMarkdown document. The stuff at the very top
of the file (the YAML with details like the title and author) will look a bit 
different than plain RMarkdown files, but once you get into the body of the post, 
you should find that the rules are very similar to RMarkdown. 

You will be creating a blog post that will include a table with the vocabulary
list as well as a few other elements. There are a few ways you can add a new
blog post file in `blogdown`. You're welcome to use any method you'd like, but
if you're not sure where to start, this is one way.



## Update your fork of the website

You should have already forked our website to add your details for the "Person" 
section. You can use this same fork to add your blog post, but you should make sure
you get your fork up-to-date with the current version of the website before you do.

A fork of a repository does not stay up-to-date with the original repository it 
copied by itself. Instead, unless you update it, it will continue to be a snapshot
of the original repository (plus any changes you've made to your copy) as of 
the time when you forked it. If the original has made a lot of changes since you 
made your fork, it might be very hard to make a clean pull request as there will 
be (potentially) lots of conflicts because of changes made to the original. It's 
considered polite to make sure that you're working with an up-to-date fork of 
a repository if you want to make a pull request back to the original.
