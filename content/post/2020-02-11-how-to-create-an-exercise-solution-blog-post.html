<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look at vignettes and helpfiles, especially for packages you are not familiar with.</li>
<li>For a lot of Bioconductor packages, object-oriented programming is used pretty
heavily. This means that associated data in R packages will often be stored in a
format that you haven’t used yet. Look up more information on data classes used in
your exercise if you aren’t familiar with them. You can use the <code>class</code> function
to determine the class of an object as well as the name of the package that defines
that class. The <code>str</code> function is often helpful for exploring a data object class, as well.
Many of the Bioconductor object classes will have special <em>accessor methods</em>, which are
functions that allow you to extract certain elements from the object—check the helpfile
for the object class, as these methods are often listed there with examples.</li>
<li>Googling can also be very helpful for learning more about functions, packages, and
datasets in R, especially if you don’t yet know what package the item is from.</li>
<li>Most Bioconductor packages have very nice vignettes available online and from your
R session once you have installed the package. These are a great place to start to find
out more about how to use the functions and object classes that come with the package.</li>
<li>Be sure to refresh yourself on all the Markdown formatting tags you can use to improve
the appearance of your post. Be sure to include things like section headings and
italics or bold as appropriate.</li>
