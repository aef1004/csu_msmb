One goal of this course is to continue developing your data science programming 
skills. This will include plenty of work on R programming, but also more work to 
help you learn tools for reproducible research, like RMarkdown and git. 

We will be using our course website as a collaboration tool during this course. 
This website was created using blogdown, which allows you to create and update a 
blogging website using R and RStudio. We are using a GitHub repository to share
all the code for this website and serving the site using GitHub Pages. 

During this course, you will have two graded products that you will need to 
submit as blog posts to our site. One will be a glossary for one chapter of the 
book, listing key words and their definitions for the chapter. The second is 
the "official" version of one week's in-course exercise. 

To help get you up to speed with using blogdown, GitHub, and RMarkdown with 
our site, we'll start by having you update your profile details for our website. 
This post covers the details for how to do that. 

# Required set-up

1. R installed on your laptop (latest version recommended)
2. RStudio installed on your laptop (latest version recommended)
3. git installed on your laptop (latest version recommended)
4. Your own GitHub account
