One goal of this course is to continue developing your data science programming 
skills. This will include plenty of work on R programming, but also more work to 
help you learn tools for reproducible research, like
[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/). 

We will be using our course website as a collaboration tool during this course.
This website was created using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/),
which allows you to create and update a blogging website using R and RStudio. We
are using a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb) to share
all the code for this website and serving the site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

During this course, you will have two graded products that you will need to 
submit as blog posts to our site. One will be a glossary for one chapter of the 
book, listing key words and their definitions for the chapter. The second is 
the "official" version of one week's in-course exercise. 

To help get you up to speed with using blogdown, GitHub, and RMarkdown with 
our site, we'll start by having you update your profile details for our website. 
This post covers the details for how to do that. 

# Required set-up

1. R installed on your laptop 

You can install R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
Search for the version appropriate for your computer's operating system. If you already
have R installed, check your version number. If it's older than six months or so, you 
should probably update your version for the class. You can use the `sessionInfo()` function
to find out details about your current R session, including the version of R you're 
currently running: 

```{r}
sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string
```

2. RStudio installed on your laptop 

You can download RStudio directly 
[from their website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). The free
Desktop version will work great for this course. If your version of RStudio is
more than a year old, you should probably update it for this course.

3. git installed on your laptop 
4. Your own GitHub account
