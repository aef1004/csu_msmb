Brooke Anderson is an assistant professor of environmental epidemiology at Colorado State University. Her research focuses on the health risks associated with climate-related 
exposures, including heat waves and air pollution, for which she has conducted several
national-level studies. As part of her research, she has also published a number of open 
source R software packages to facilitate environmental epidemiologic research.
