&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips on writing up the vocabulary list for a chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should include all words in the chapter that are given in bold. Be sure to
look for bolded terms in the sidenotes and end-of-chapter exercises, too! Occassionally,
the authors use bold for subheadings (see the “Why R and Bioconductor?” section in
the Introduction or the “Summary of this chapter” section of Chapter 1). These
subheadings do not need to be included in the vocabulary list for the chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find one or more common synonyms for a term, you can include that with
the term in the list (e.g., “variability / spread / dispersion”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is fine to use wording from the chapter text or to use wording directly from
other websites or sources. However, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; include a list of any of the
sources that you used to write your definitions at the bottom of the vocabulary
blog post. Further, if you are using sources besides the course textbook, make sure
that the definition is appropriate in the context of our course. Often, words will
have a number of different definitions across different disciplines. Try to use
more formal sources (e.g., textbooks, other published books) rather than less
formal websites to find definitions whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to change a term from singular to plural or vice versa if it helps you
in writing the term’s definition. Similarly, if the bolded term does not include
all the words that would be helpful (e.g., the bolded term is “sufficient”, but
the term of interest is “sufficient statistic”), you can add a word or two to the
bolded term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bolded terms in the book tend to favor statistical terms over biological ones.
If there are some biological terms you needed to look up when you read the chapter,
or that you think some people in the class might not know,
feel free to add them to your vocabulary list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can see an example of a vocabulary blog post for
&lt;a href=&#34;http://127.0.0.1:4736/post/vocabulary-for-chapter-1/&#34;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt;. You can
use this as templates for your own post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to include the tag “vocabulary”, as well as a tag for your chapter, on
the blog post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are two bolded words that mean the same thing, put them both on the
vocabulary list (with the same definition).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a vocabulary term was defined in a previous chapter’s vocabulary list, feel free
to reuse the definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our library has excellent resources that you can use to help write your definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of your assignments for this class, you are responsible for creating a blog
post with all the vocabulary and definitions for one week of the course. This
blog post will explain how you can create and publish that blog post on our
course website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;create-the-blog-post&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Create the blog post&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;making-a-new-blog-post&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a new blog post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;, each blog post is an RMarkdown document. The stuff at the very top
of the file (the YAML with details like the title and author) will look a bit
different than plain RMarkdown files, but once you get into the body of the post,
you should find that the rules are very similar to RMarkdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be creating a blog post that will include a table with the vocabulary
list as well as a few other elements. There are a few ways you can add a new
blog post file in &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;. You’re welcome to use any method you’d like, but
if you’re not sure where to start, this is one way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;update-your-fork-of-the-website&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update your fork of the website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have already forked our website to add your details for the “Person”
section. You can use this same fork to add your blog post, but you should make sure
you get your fork up-to-date with the current version of the website before you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fork of a repository does not stay up-to-date with the original repository it
copied by itself. Instead, unless you update it, it will continue to be a snapshot
of the original repository (plus any changes you’ve made to your copy) as of
the time when you forked it. If the original has made a lot of changes since you
made your fork, it might be very hard to make a clean pull request as there will
be (potentially) lots of conflicts because of changes made to the original. It’s
considered polite to make sure that you’re working with an up-to-date fork of
a repository if you want to make a pull request back to the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Git code to update fork]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Updating your local branch]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;creating-a-new-blog-post&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a new blog post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;create-the-vocabulary-list&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Create the vocabulary list&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;identify-the-vocabulary-terms-you-need-to-define&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identify the vocabulary terms you need to define&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;create-a-.tsv-file-with-terms-and-definitions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a .tsv file with terms and definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;adding-r-code-to-show-the-list-in-the-post&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding R code to show the list in the post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;creating-and-embedding-a-quizlet-app&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating and embedding a Quizlet app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;submit-the-post&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Submit the post&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;pushing-your-changes-to-your-remote-repo&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pushing your changes to your remote repo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;submitting-a-pull-request-to-the-original-repo&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Submitting a pull request to the original repo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;edit-and-re-submit-the-post-based-on-faculty-feedback&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Edit and re-submit the post based on faculty feedback&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
