probability model	
vector	
discrete event	
categorical variable	A variable that can belong to one of a finite set of levels.
levels	In the context of a categorical variable, the set of groups to which the variable can be assigned.
factor	
exchangeable	A way to describe a random variable for which the order that the data are observed doesn't matter
sufficient statistic	A statistic that, even though it is a summary, contains all the information that you would use from an original, uncondensed form of the data. An example is frequency counts for an exchangeable ...
Bernoulli distribution	A probability distribution to describe the outcome probability for two possible events.
parameter	A numerical value that describes a population or a model.
complementary	A description of two events who are mutually exclusive and whose probabilities sum to one. In other words, either one event or the other is guaranteed to happen, but not both.
binomial random variable	A variable whose values occur according to a binomial probability distribution.
probability mass distribution	
Poisson distribution	A probability distribution that is appropriate when the probability of success is small and the number of trials is large.
epitope	Site on a macromolecular antigen to which an antibody binds. This is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system and is also known as an antigen determinent.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)	An assay that is used to detect specific epitopes at different positions along a protein.
conditional on	Given
cumulative distribution function	
extreme value analysis	Analysis focused on the behavior of the very large or the very small values of a random distribution, allowing an exploration of the probability of rare events.
rare events	Something that occurs with a very low probability.
rank statistic	A statistic based on the order of the relative positions of observations based on a certain characteristics.
Monte Carlo method	A method that uses a computer simulation based on our generative model that finds the probabilities of the events we're interested in.
probability or generative modeling	A method of modeling where all the parameters are known and the mathematical theory allows us to work by deduction.
deduction	A top-down method of reasoning ...
statistical modeling	A method of modeling where the distribution of the data is not known.
fit	In the context of data and a statistical distribution, ...
multinomial	
power	The probability of detecting something if it is there.
true positive rate	The probability of detecting something if it is there.
null hypothesis	
matrix	
expected value	
variability	
statistic	A numerical characteristic of a sample
null distribution	
alternative	In the context of a generating process, ...
chi-squared distribution	
p-value	The probability of seeing the data that were observed given a hypothesis.
probability density function	
default	In the context of function parameters for an R function, the value that is used if no custom value is specified.
