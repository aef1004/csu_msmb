finite mixture	data that contains a few components
infinite mixture	data that contains the same number of components as observations
bimodal distribution	distribution comprised of two peaks
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm	an algorithm that allows for parameter estimation in proabailistic models with incomplete data
data augmentation	adding variables that are not measured (latent varibles) to the data
latent variable	variables not measured in the data
bivariate distribution	a combined distribution made of two random variables
marginal likelihood	sum of all possible values for the densitities
model averaging	the process of using several models and combining them together into a weighted model
zero inflated data	data that contains a large number of zero counts
point mass	a finite probabiliity concentrated at a point in the proability mass distribution at which there is a discontinuous segment in proability density function
sampling distribution	the probability distribution calculated from a random sample 
bootstrap	an approximation of the true sampling distribution; created by drawing new samples from the empirical dstirubtion of the original sample
nonparametric bootstrap 	an approximation of the true samplin distriubtion not based off of specific assumptionf or a particular model
negative binomial distribution/ gamma-Poisson distubtion	the probability distribution of the number of failures before the kth success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials
dispersion	the amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean
variance-stabilizing transformations	transformations designed to give approximate independence between mean and variance
heteroscedasticity	the varaicne of the data is different in different regions of the data
delta method	a calculus procedure that uses random variables to approximate the expected value and variance of a function
