This will include plenty of work on R programming, but also more to\rhelp you learn tools for reproducible research, like\rRMarkdown and git.\nWe will be using our course website as a collaboration tool during this course.\rThis website was created using blogdown,\rwhich allows you to create and update a blogging website with R and RStudio. We\rare using a GitHub repository to share\rall the code for this website and serving the site using Netlify.\nDuring this course, you will have two graded products that you will need to\rsubmit as blog posts to our site. One will be a glossary of vocabulary terms for\rone chapter of the book, listing key words and their definitions for the\rchapter. The second will be the “official” version of one week’s in-course exercise.\nTo help get you up to speed with using blogdown, GitHub, and RMarkdown with\rour site, we’ll start by having you update your profile details for our website.\rWe’ll also use this to give you all a chance to introduce yourselves to each\rother and to us. This post covers the details for how to do that.\nRequired set-up\rThis exercise, and this course as a whole, requires a certain set-up\ron your computer:\nR installed on your laptop\rRStudio installed on your laptop\rgit installed on your laptop\rYour own GitHub account\r\rIf you already have all this set-up, you can skip to the next section.\rOtherwise, this section has details on completing this set up.\nInstall R on your laptop\rYou can install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\rSearch for the version appropriate for your computer’s operating system.\nIf you already have R installed, check your version number. If it’s older than\rsix months or so, you should probably update your version for the class. You can\ruse the sessionInfo() function to find out details about your current R\rsession, including the version of R you’re currently running:\nsessionInfo()\r## R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12)\r## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)\r## Running under: macOS Mojave 10.14.6\r## ## Matrix products: default\r## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib\r## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\r## ## locale:\r## [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\r## ## attached base packages:\r## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached):\r## [1] compiler_3.6.2 magrittr_1.5 bookdown_0.16 tools_3.6.2 ## [5] htmltools_0.4.0 yaml_2.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.3 stringi_1.4.5 ## [9] rmarkdown_2.0 blogdown_0.17 knitr_1.26 stringr_1.4.0 ## [13] digest_0.6.23 xfun_0.12 rlang_0.4.2 evaluate_0.14\rBased on the return from this call, for example, I can tell that I have\rR version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12).\n\rInstall RStudio on your laptop\rYou can download RStudio directly\rfrom their website. The free\rDesktop version will work great for this course. If your version of RStudio is\rmore than a year old, you should probably update it for this course. To check\ryour version of R Studio, open R Studio, go to the “RStudio” tab at the top,\rand click on “About RStudio”.\n\rInstall git on your laptop\rThe software git is version control software, which will help you record and\rtrack changes that you’ve made to code and other plain text documents.\nIt’s free to download. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and select the version\rfor your operating system. For this software, you’re probably okay if you\rdownloaded it a little while ago (although if more than two years or so, you might\rwant to update).\n\rGet a GitHub account\rYou will need a (free) GitHub account for this course. You can sign up for one\r(if you don’t already have one) at https://github.com/. While there are some\rfancier paid plans available, the free account will work great for this class.\nWhen you sign up, you’ll get to choose a GitHub handle. You might want to make\rthis something that will be easy for people to remember. For example, if your\rname is still available, that would be a great option. This handle will form\rpart of the address to all of your GitHub repositories, so it is convenient if\rit is easy for people you work with to remember (mine, unfortunately, is not!).\n\r\rAbout blogdown\rThe blogdown package is an R package created by Yihui Xie that allows you\rto use R and RStudio to create and update your own webpage with a blog. The\rappeal of being able to do this with R is that you can write blog posts\rusing RMarkdown, so you can include executable R code in each post.\nblogdown creates your site using the Hugo framework.\rHugo is software that can build static websites (i.e., ones that can be\rserved to viewers without needing database backends or other fancy things).\rPeople have created different templates for Hugo-generated websites, and these\rtemplates provide the structure and framework, while you can adapt the content.\nThis means that our website (which is, essentially, a collection of files in\ra directory written in a form that a web browser can convert to a pretty\rwebsite) includes a lot of files and code that come straight from a template\rthat someone else wrote, and then places here and there where we can add or\rchange the files to make the website ours.\nOne of the ways that you can change the website is to add posts. You’ll be\rdoing this later in the course by contributing two blog posts of your own,\rone on the vocabulary for a chapter and one with the “official” version of\rthe exercise for a chapter. We’ll cover more on how to add a blog post later\rin the course.\nThe other way that you can change the website is to change some of its\r“front page” data. The website has a section on “People”, with the\rprofiles of everyone in the class. The information shown in this section\ris all saved in plain text files in our website’s file directory. Today,\ryou’ll change you details in the file dedicated to you and then send those\rchanges back to us so we can update the online version of the site.\nYou will need to install two pieces of software to work on our\rwebsite. First, you’ll need the R package blogdown. You can install\rthis package in the normal way, using install.packages:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;)\rOnce you have blogdown, you can install the Hugo software using a function\rin the blogdown package, install_hugo:\nlibrary(blogdown)\rinstall_hugo()\rFor both these installations, your computer will need to be online or you’ll\rget an error.\n\rGetting a fork of our repository on your computer\rAll our websites files are posted in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/geanders/csu_msmb. With this (or any) GitHub repository,\ryou can suggest changes by forking the repository, cloning the fork to\ryour computer, making and committing the changes, pushing those commits\rback up to your fork of the repository on GitHub, and then submitting\ra pull request.\nForking a GitHub repository\r\r\rvia GIPHY\rWhen you fork a GitHub repository, you get a copy of that repository that you\rcan play around with and change yourself, without it affecting the original\rrepository. It’s essentially just copying the whole repository, with all its\rfiles, into a repository on your GitHub account.\nThe only thing that makes it different from a plain copy (and what makes it\rreally powerful in some cases) is that, if you decide that your changes might\rmake the original repository better, you can submit a pull request. This\rrequests that the owners of the original repository update it to incorporate the\rchanges you’ve made on your fork of the repository. The original authors can\rreview each of the commits you’ve made, so they can even cherry-pick your\rchanges if they want.\nGitHub also lets the original authors see if there are any merge conflicts\rcreated from changes that they’ve made to the original repository since you\rforked it. This can let the original authors see how hard it will be to\rincorporate all of your changes in the forked version with their version of the\rrepository.\nTo fork the repository with our course’s website materials, all you’ll need to\rdo is go to our GitHub repository for the course\rwebsite (while you’re signed in to\rGitHub) and click on the “Fork” button towards the right of the page. Now go and\rcheck in the “Repositories” section of your own GitHub account—you should see that\ryou now have a forked copy of the “csu_msmb” repository.\nIn this exercise, you’ll work with the fork of the repository, and then once you’ve\rmade your changes, you submit a pull request, so that we can get your changes\rback into the main webpage.\nIf you need more help on how to fork a repository, GitHub has a help\rpage\ron the topic that might be useful.\n\rCloning the fork to your computer\rNext, you’ll want to get a copy of your forked repository onto your own computer,\rwhere you can work with it, make changes, and preview the website with your\rupdates.\nTo do this, you’ll clone your fork of the repository onto your computer.\rThe version of the repository on GitHub is called the remote branch of the\rrepository and the version you get on your computer once you’ve cloned it is\rthe local branch. By cloning (instead of just downloading), you’ll maintain\ra connection between the remote and local versions through git, which will allow\ryou to push changes that you make and commit on your own computer up to the\rremote branch on GitHub.\nGo to GitHub, make sure you are logged into your account, and navigate to your\rforked version of the repository for this class. There should be a button to the\rright of the page that says “Clone or download” (you may need to scroll down to\rfind it).\nWhen you click on this button, it will give you a choice between\r“SSH” and “HTTPS” for the protocol to use to connect your local and remote branches\rof the repository. You’re welcome to try either, but I usually (on a Mac) have\rbetter luck with “SSH”. Occasionally, people running Windows in my courses have\rhad better luck with “HTTPS”, although for most folks “SSH” seems to work fine.\rOnce you choose which protocol to use, you can copy the snippet of code that is\rgiven in the pop-up.\nNext, you’ll run this code from a bash shell on your own computer to clone the\rrepository. You first will need to open a shell. If you’re on a Mac, you can do that\rwith the “Terminal” application. With Windows, you’ll probably need to use the\rbash shell that comes with the Windows version of git. Search your programs for\r“bash” or “git bash” and see if you see something that looks promising.\nOnce you open a shell, you’ll see a command prompt, like this:\nusername$\rYou can type shell commands here and then press “Return” to run them. You\rshould first move into the directory where you want to clone the repository.\rYour “Desktop” might be a good place for it for now (unless you have some\rorganization you use for course-related files). The cd shell command lets you\r“change directory”. If you don’t put anything after cd, it will change to\ryour home directory. Otherwise, it will move to the directory you specify.\rFor example, if the “Desktop” directory is a subdirectory of my home directory,\rI could move into it by running:\ncd Desktop\rIf you have not use shell commands much before and are having any problems\rnavigating to the directory you’d like, let us know in class, and one of us can\rhelp you.\nOnce you are in this directory, you’ll paste git clone followed by the command\ryou copied from the “Clone or download” button on GitHub. It will probably look\rsomething like this (but with your GitHub handle in place of “geanders”):\ngit clone git@github.com:geanders/csu_msmb.git\rWhen you run this, you may have to put in your GitHub username and password. You\rmay also get some questions about whether you really want to download the\rrepository (you do). If everything’s successful, you should see that there’s a new\rdirectory called “csu_msmb” in which directory you decided to put it (“Desktop”,\rfor example).\nThis directory has a special file in it that makes it an R Project—a special\rversion of a file directory with some extra structure and saved preferences. Make\rsure that you open the project as a whole when you work on it in R Studio, rather than\ropening just by clicking on one of the files. To do this, you can go in R Studio\rto \"File\" -\u0026gt; \"Open Project...\" and then navigate through your file directory\rto the “csu_msmb” directory you just cloned.\nIf you need more help, GitHub has a help\rpage\rwith more on how to clone a repository from GitHub to your own computer.\n\rChanging and committing in RStudio\rWhen you have R Studio open to an R Project that is using git version control,\rR Studio will include a “Git” pane. You can use this pane to commit changes you\rmake to files in the repository, write messages explaining those commits, and\rpush your changes to your remote branch of the repository on GitHub.\nWhen you commit a change, that change is written into a log of every change made\rto the files in the repository. You can later look through these commits, so you’ll\rwant the commit messages to make sense when you read them in the future. When you’re\rcollaborating with others, the commit messages will help you see what each other\rare doing.\nWhen you first commit a change, the commit is only saved in your local branch.\rTo send it up to the remote branch of the repository on GitHub, you’ll need to\rpush those commits. Once you push your local commits, your GitHub repository\rshould exactly mirror your local repository.\nAs soon as you make a change to a file in the repository that’s being track by\rgit, that file will show up in the Git pane, with a little check box beside it.\rWhen you’re ready to commit a change, click on the “Commit” button on the top left\rof the Git pane. This will open a pop-up box.\nIn this box, click the check boxes for all the changed files on the left you’d\rlike to include in the commit. Then write a short commit message, describing\rthe changes you’ve made. You should try to fit it all in the first line of the\r“commit message” window. If you can’t, write a short description in the first line,\rskip a line, and then you can write as much as you want.\nOnce you’ve written your commit message, click on the “commit” button. This will\rrecord this commit. To check that it has, you can go to the “History” tab and\rmake sure the commit shows up as the last thing in your history.\n\r\rUpdating your profile details\rRendering blogdown websites in RStudio\rOnce you’ve opened the R Project with our website, you can use the\rblogdown package to serve the website. This will only update and\rshow the website on your computer (not change our main website online),\rbut it lets you check that everything’s working and preview what the\rsite will look like online.\nRStudio’s “Viewer” pane can work as a web browser. This means that it can\rshow our website. When you have opened the R Project with the cloned\rrepository of our website (“csu_msmb”), try running the following in your\rR console to render the site:\nlibrary(blogdown)\rserve_site()\rIf everything worked, you should be able to see a version of the website in your\rRStudio “Viewer” pane. If you’d like to see it in your usual web browser, click\ron the “Show in new window” button on the top left of the “Viewer” pane (this\rlooks like a little rectangle with an arrow on it). This will open the website\rin your default web browser.\nTake a look at the web address when you do—it should start with 127.0.0.1.\rThis is a loopback address—an IP address that refers back to your local\rcomputer (localhost), rather than an outside web servers. Anytime you’re\rbuilding a website and checking it locally, you’ll see this in the web address\rwhen you open the site in a web browser. (You can even get T shirts with “There’s no place like\r127.0.0.1”).\nAs you work through the next parts of the exercise, the rendered website in the\rViewer pane should update every time you save your changes to files in the\rwebsite. If you have the website open in your default browser, too, you might\rwant to refresh the site with the normal “Refresh” button for your browser.\rIf things ever seem like they’ve gotten out of sink, you can always re-run\rserve_site().\n\rNavigating the website’s file directory to find your profile\rWe all have our own author profile in a subdirectory within the\rwebsite’s files. To find yours, go to the “content” subdirectory\rof the website files and then the “authors” subdirectory within that.\rYou should see a subdirectory there with your name. Click on that\rand you’ll see the two files that make up your author profile,\r\"_index.md\" and “avatar.jpg”.\n\rUpdating your information in \"_index.md\"\rYour details are all given in the \"_index.md\" file in your author subdirectory.\rTo update your details on the website, you’ll need to change your details in this\rfile.\nThe file is written in a Markup language called YAML. If you’ve used RMarkdown\rbefore, you might recognize this syntax from the information that goes at the\rvery top of each RMarkdown file.\nIn your \"_index.md\" file, anywhere there is a placeholder, like “[Year]”\ror “[Institution]”, replace the placeholder with your own information.\nBe very careful when changing things like spaces and hyphens in the structure,\ras YAML is based on parsing these elements. As with any Markup language, as\ryou are learning it, it’s best to try to render the final document often as\ryou make changes, so you can make sure the changes make it through like you want\rand so you can catch any problems quickly.\nMake sure you change the following sections:\n\rbio:\reducation:\remail:\rinterests:\rname:\rorganizations:\r\rSome of the sections in social: are commented out, including the information\rfor buttons for GitHub, GoogleScholar, and Twitter. If you have accounts through\rany of these services, you can add these buttons with your updated information.\rJust delete the # at the beginning of all lines in that section and then\rchange the handle or web address information so that it links to your\raccount for that service. In this section, also update your email address, with\rmailto: at the beginning, for the email icon.\nThe very bottom of the file, under the ---, provides space for you to write\ra paragraph summarizing who you are and your academic / research interests.\nBe sure to save the file after you’ve made all your changes.\nFor an example of a completed \"_index.md\" file, you can see mine here.\n\rUpdating your avatar picture\rThere’s also a place in your author profile directory to include a photo to\rrepresent yourself. To change from the default (the blue guy), replace the\r“avatar.jpg” file in your author profile directory with the JPG of your choice,\rand use the same file name (“avatar.jpg”).\nIt would be helpful for you to use a photo of yourself, since that will help\rus put names with faces, but if you don’t have one or would prefer\rnot to use your own photo, feel free to pick any photo (for which you have\rappropriate permissions) to use.\nYou might need to crop your photo some to get it to show up in the circle on\rthe website correctly. Try with your uncropped picture once, check the website\rin the RStudio Viewer pane to see how it looks, and then if it doesn’t work,\rplay around with cropping it until you’re happy.\n\r\rSubmitting your updates\rPushing the commits back to GitHub\rWhen you are ready to push all the changes you’ve committed to your local branch, you can\rdo this from the Git pane in R Studio. In this pane, there are two arrows: a green up\rarrow and a blue down arrow. Click on the green up arrow to push the commits from your\rcomputer (the local branch) to GitHub (the remote branch). Visit your GitHub page for\rthe repository (or refresh it if you already had it open) and check if your changes\rhave successfully been pushed to the remote branch.\nIf you haven’t created an SSH key and shared it with GitHub, you may be asked\rfor your GitHub password every time you try to push. This will get to be a pain,\rso you’ll probably want to set up an SSH key. For more on how to do this (as\rwell as other help with using RStudio with version control), check out\rRStudio’s help documentation on the\rtopic.\n\rRequesting that we pull your changes\r\r\rvia GIPHY\rAt this point, you’ve made changes, checked them, and pushed them to your GitHub version of\rthe repository. Remember, though, that you forked the repository from our original one, and\rso you’ve been working with a copy of the repository this whole time, rather than changing\rour original version.\nTo get your changes incorporated into our original version, you’ll need to request that we\rpull your changes into the original repository. To do this, you can submit a pull request\rthrough GitHub. Go to the main page for your fork of the GitHub repository and look for\ra button that says “New pull request”. When you click this, it will walk you through making\ra pull request. You’ll have a space to write a message describing the changes you’re\rrecommending in the pull request.\nIf you’d like more details on this information, GitHub has help documentation\ron pull\rrequests.\n\r\r","date":1578873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578952088,"objectID":"aaf734a217c669a7993ece1eb560bb61","permalink":"/post/add-profile-details/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/add-profile-details/","section":"post","summary":"One goal of this course is to continue developing your data science programming\rskills.
