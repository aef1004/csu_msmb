&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips on writing up the vocabulary list for a chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should include all words in the chapter that are given in bold. Be sure to
look for bolded terms in the sidenotes and end-of-chapter exercises, too! Occassionally,
the authors use bold for subheadings (see the “Why R and Bioconductor?” section in
the Introduction or the “Summary of this chapter” section of Chapter 1). These
subheadings do not need to be included in the vocabulary list for the chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find one or more common synonyms for a term, you can include that with
the term in the list (e.g., “variability / spread / dispersion”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is fine to use wording from the chapter text or to use wording directly from
other websites or sources. However, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; include a list of any of the
sources that you used to write your definitions at the bottom of the vocabulary
blog post. Further, if you are using sources besides the course textbook, make sure
that the definition is appropriate in the context of our course. Often, words will
have a number of different definitions across different disciplines. Try to use
more formal sources (e.g., textbooks, other published books) rather than less
formal websites to find definitions whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to change a term from singular to plural or vice versa if it helps you
in writing the term’s definition. Similarly, if the bolded term does not include
all the words that would be helpful (e.g., the bolded term is “sufficient”, but
the term of interest is “sufficient statistic”), you can add a word or two to the
bolded term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bolded terms in the book tend to favor statistical terms over biological ones.
If there are some biological terms you needed to look up when you read the chapter,
or that you think some people in the class might not know,
feel free to add them to your vocabulary list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can see an example of a vocabulary blog post for
&lt;a href=&#34;http://127.0.0.1:4736/post/vocabulary-for-chapter-1/&#34;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt;. You can
use this as templates for your own post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to include the tag “vocabulary”, as well as a tag for your chapter, on
the blog post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are two bolded words that mean the same thing, put them both on the
vocabulary list (with the same definition).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a vocabulary term was defined in a previous chapter’s vocabulary list, feel free
to reuse the definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our library has excellent resources that you can use to help write your definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
